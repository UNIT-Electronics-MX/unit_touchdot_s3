Installing packages - Micropython
=================================

This section will guide you through the installation process of the required libraries using 
the `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ package manager.



Installation Guide Using MIP Library
-------------------------------------
.. note::
    The `mip` library is utilized to install other libraries  for MicroPython on the ESP32-S3. It simplifies the process of managing and installing packages directly from the internet.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ESP32-S3 device
- Thonny IDE
- Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and Password)

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps below to install the `max1704x.py` library:

Connect to Wi-Fi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy and run the code below in Thonny to connect your ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network:


.. code-block:: python

   import mip
   import network
   import time

   def connect_wifi(ssid, password):
      wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
      wlan.active(True)
      wlan.connect(ssid, password)

      for _ in range(10):
         if wlan.isconnected():
               print('Connected to the Wi-Fi network')
               return wlan.ifconfig()[0]
         time.sleep(1)

      print('Could not connect to the Wi-Fi network')
      return None


    ssid = "your_ssid"
    password = "your_password"

   ip_address = connect_wifi(ssid, password)
   print(ip_address)
   mip.install('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UNIT-Electronics/MAX1704X_lib/refs/heads/main/Software/MicroPython/example/max1704x.py')
   mip.install('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cesarbautista10/Libraries_compatibles_with_micropython/refs/heads/main/Libs/oled.py')
   mip.install('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cesarbautista10/Libraries_compatibles_with_micropython/refs/heads/main/Libs/sdcard.py')



DualMCU Library
-----------------

Firstly, you need install Thonny IDE. You can download it from the `Thonny website <https://thonny.org/>`__.

1. Open `Thonny <https://thonny.org/>`__.
2. Navigate to **Tools** -> **Manage Packages**.
3. Search for ``dualmcu`` and click **Install**.

.. _figure_dualmcu_libary:

.. figure:: /_static/img/dualmcu_library.png

   DualMCU Library Successfully Installed

Alternatively, download the library from `dualmcu.py <https://pypi.org/project/dualmcu/>`__.


Usage
~~~~~

The library provides a set of tools to help developers work with the DualMCU ONE board. The following are the main features of the library:

- **I2C Support**: The library provides support for I2C communication protocol, making it easy to interface with a wide range of sensors and devices.

- **Arduino Shields Compatibility**: The library is compatible with Arduino Shields, making it easy to use a wide range of shields and accessories with the DualMCU ONE board.

- **SDcard Support**: The library provides support for SD cards, allowing developers to easily read and write data to SD cards.


Examples of the library usage:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    from dualmcu import *

    i2c = machine.SoftI2C( scl=machine.Pin(22), sda=machine.Pin(21))

    oled = SSD1306_I2C(128, 64, i2c)

    oled.fill(1)
    oled.show()

    oled.fill(0)
    oled.show()
    oled.text('UNIT', 50, 10)
    oled.text('ELECTRONICS', 25, 20)

    oled.show()
